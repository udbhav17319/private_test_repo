Write me a Python script that calculates prime numbers up to 500 and prints them.


Draft Python code for a function that reverses a linked list. Don’t execute it, just give me the code and then review it for improvements.


Here’s my code, can you review it for performance and style?

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
